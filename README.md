# Book Connect

Book Connect is a web application that allows users to search for books and view their details. It provides a book preview component that encapsulates the display of book information.

## Discription

In this challenge, you need to take the existing book preview functionality in the "Book Connect" codebase and convert it into a fully-working web component. This means encapsulating the display of book information within a single factory function that creates the web component. Additionally, if you're up for it, you can also convert other aspects of the application into web components.

To complete the challenge, follow these steps:

Implement a factory function that creates the book preview web component.
The book preview component should encapsulate the display of book information, including the title, author, publication date, description, and a preview link.
Use the techniques you've learned about web components to create a reusable component that can be included in any part of the application.
If you want, you can convert other parts of the application into web components as well.
